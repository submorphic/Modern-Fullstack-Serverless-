### Modern Serverless Philosophy: 


The term serverless is commonly associated with FaaS. Though you
will find varying definitions as to what it means, the term has recently
grown to encompass more of a philosophy than a shared definition.

Many times when people talk about serverless, they are really
describing how to most efficiently deliver business value with a focus
on writing business logic, instead of coding supporting infrastructure
for your business logic. 

Adopting a serverless mindset allows you to
do this by consciously going out of your way to find and leverage
FaaS, managed services, and smart abstractions, while only building
custom solutions if an existing service just doesn’t yet exist.


More and more companies and developers are taking this approach,
as it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel. With the increase in
popularity of this philosophy, there has also been an explosion of
services and tools made available from startups and cloud providers
to provide offerings that simplify backend complexity.
