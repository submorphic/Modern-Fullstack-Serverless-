## Building Skills for GraphQL, AppSync API, and React Router 

In this section, we’ll cover how to model relationships between GraphQL types, how to implement authorization rules on GraphQL types and fields, how to enable multiple authorization modes for an AppSync API, and how to enable route parameters using React Router.

### Relationships Between GraphQL Types

When creating a GraphQL API, or any API, modeling relationships between data becomes very important to understand.

For example, the app that we are building will have the following two types:


#### Stage
This type will hold the stage information for individual
performances, including the stage name and stage ID. Each stage
will have a number of performances that are associated with it.


#### Performance
This type will hold the individual performance information,
including the performer, the description, the stage of the
performance, and the time of the performance.

For this type of API, ideally you would want to have at least the following access patterns:

Query for a single stage and performances for the stage

Query for all stages and performances for each stage

Query for an individual performance and the corresponding stage info

Query for all performances and the corresponding stage info

The question is now usually this: how can you enable these different
relationships and access patterns? And in our case, how can we do
this using a NoSQL database like DynamoDB? There are two ways to
accomplish this:

Pattern your data in DynamoDB in a way that enables all of
these access patterns to be performed using a single table by
taking advantage of a combination of primary keys, sort
keys, and local secondary indexes. For this to work with
AppSync, we would have to write and maintain all of the
resolver logic by hand and from scratch.

Enable these relationships directly at the resolver level.
Because we are using GraphQL, and GraphQL enables per-
field resolvers, this can be done. To understand this better
let’s take a look at one of the types we will be working with.
