## Building Skills for GraphQL, AppSync API, and React Router 

In this section, we’ll cover how to model relationships between GraphQL types, how to implement authorization rules on GraphQL types and fields, how to enable multiple authorization modes for an AppSync API, and how to enable route parameters using React Router.

### Relationships Between GraphQL Types

When creating a GraphQL API, or any API, modeling relationships between data becomes very important to understand.

For example, the app that we are building will have the following two types:


#### Stage
This type will hold the stage information for individual
performances, including the stage name and stage ID. Each stage
will have a number of performances that are associated with it.


#### Performance
This type will hold the individual performance information,
including the performer, the description, the stage of the
performance, and the time of the performance.
