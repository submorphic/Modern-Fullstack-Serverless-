# Chapter 9, Building Offline Apps with Amplify DataStore

Amplify supports another type of API for interacting with AppSync: Amplify DataStore. DataStore has a different approach than a traditional GraphQL API.

Instead of interacting with the GraphQL API itself, using queries and mutations, DataStore introduces a client-side SDK that allows you to write to and read from a local store and persists this data locally using the local storage engine of the platform you are working with (i.e., IndexDB for web and SQLite for native iOS and Android).

DataStore then automatically syncs the local data to the GraphQL backend for you as updates are made both locally and remotely.

Using the DataStore SDK, you then only have to perform the
operations like save, update, and delete, writing directly to DataStore
itself. DataStore handles everything else for you: it syncs your data to
the cloud when you have an internet connection, and if you’re not
online, will queue it for the next time you’re connected.

## About Amplify DataStore

Amplify DataStore is a combination of the following things:

AppSync GraphQL API.

Local storage repository and syncing engine that also persists data offline.

Client-side SDK for interacting with the local storage repository.

Special sync-enabled GraphQL resolvers (generated by the Amplify CLI) that enable sophisticated conflict detection and conflict resolution on the server.

### Amplify DataStore Overview

When getting started with DataStore, you still create the API as we have done in past chapters. The main difference is, when creating the
API, you will enable conflict detection in the advanced settings of the CLI flow.

From there, to enable DataStore on the client, we need to create
models for DataStore to use to interact with the storage repository.

This can easily be done by just using the GraphQL schema you
already have and running a build command—amplify codegen
models—from the CLI.


Now, you are all set up and can begin interacting with DataStore.
