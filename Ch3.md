# Chapter 3. Creating Your First App

In this part, you will be creating a GraphQL API that interacts
with a DynamoDB NoSQL database to perform CRUD+L (create,
read, update, delete, and list) operations. You’ll learn what GraphQL
is, why developers are adopting it, and how it works.

We will be building a notes app that will allow users to create,
update, and delete notes. It will also have GraphQL subscriptions
enabled in order to see updates in real time. If another user is
interacting with the app and they create a new note, our app will
update with the new values in real time.

Let’s have a look at what GraphQL is, what a GraphQL API consists
of, and how GraphQL works.
