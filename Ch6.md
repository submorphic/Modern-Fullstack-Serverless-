# Chapter 6,  Serverless Functions In-Depth


In previous parts, you learned how to create and interact with a serverless
API using API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Here, you’ll continue to
learn about how to use serverless functions by creating two new types
of functions. The functions in this part will be different in that,
instead of using them as strictly a web server or an API, you’ll be
using them to interact with other AWS services to aid in the
application-development process.
