# Chapter 2,  Getting Started with AWS Amplify

At the core of most applications is the data/API layer. This layer
could look like many things. In the serverless world, this usually will
be composed of a combination of API endpoints and serverless
functions. These serverless functions could be doing some logic and
returning data, interacting with a database of some kind, or even
interacting with another API endpoint.

There are two main ways of creating APIs with Amplify:
1. A combination of Amazon API Gateway and a Lambda
function

2. A GraphQL API connected to some type of data source
(database, Lambda function, or HTTP endpoint)
